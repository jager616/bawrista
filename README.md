baWrista: a coffee timer for the Pebble smartwatch

Overview
--
I got an Aeropress recently, and it brews an awesome cup.

But I needed a timer for steeping and pressing. When Pebble released their SDK last week, I knew exactly what to do.

Introducing baWrista.

Set steep time and press time with the up and down buttons, then confirm each with the select button.

The Pebble's vibration feature lets you know when to start applying pressure, and when your Aeropress coffee is done.

Enjoy!
